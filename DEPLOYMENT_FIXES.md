# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SciPy Build Error
**Problem**: SciPy 1.13.1 required Fortran compiler which wasn't available on Render
**Solution**: Downgraded to SciPy 1.11.4 and other scientific packages to versions with pre-compiled wheels

### 2. Python Version Compatibility
**Problem**: Python 3.13.4 had compatibility issues with some packages
**Solution**: Changed runtime.txt to Python 3.11.7 (more stable for deployment)

### 3. OpenCV Issues
**Problem**: opencv-python can cause issues in headless environments
**Solution**: Changed to opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78

### 4. Package Version Conflicts
**Problem**: Some packages had version conflicts
**Solution**: Downgraded to compatible versions:
- pandas: 2.2.3 → 2.1.4
- numpy: 1.26.4 → 1.24.4
- matplotlib: 3.8.4 → 3.7.5
- And others...

### 5. Start Script Robustness
**Problem**: API key check could prevent startup in production
**Solution**: Changed from sys.exit(1) to warning message

## Files Modified

1. `requirements.txt` - Updated package versions
2. `runtime.txt` - Changed Python version to 3.11.7
3. `start_server.py` - Made API key check non-blocking
4. `render.yaml` - Added pip upgrade to build command
5. `requirements-minimal.txt` - Created minimal dependency set (backup)

## Next Steps

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your "data-analyst-agent" service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Monitor the build logs
5. Once deployed, test the endpoint

## Testing the Deployment

Use the provided `test_deployment.py` script:

```bash
python test_deployment.py
```

Or test manually:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.onrender.com/api/" \
  -F "file=@test_question.txt"
```
